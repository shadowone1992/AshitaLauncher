##Ashita Launcher
==============================================

# What is it?
  Ashita Laucher is the new launcher that I have been working on for Ashita to replace the current loader.
Mainly this is to give the laoder a full makeover and to add more features to it. This is also to step in another open source direction as after this beta the source to the loader will be public. (The file is a .NET file and is unprotected if you wish to look at the source now. But the actual source will be posted later.)

# What does it do?
  As of this beta the new launcher includes the following:

* **Launcher**
  * Create new configurations.
  * Edit existing configurations.
  * Delete existing configurations.
  * Launch configurations as before.
* **Updater**
  * Scan for out of date files.
  * Update specific files.
  * Update all files.
* **Misc Features**
  * Custom theme coloring. (Configurable)
  * Update file filtering. (Using regular expressions.)
  * Links to bug reports and forums easily accessible.
  * Proper command line booting. (Supports multiple files at once to launch multiple instances.)
  * Open-source! (After the beta.)
